# GreenCoptor

Coptor was a popular flash based game which I used to play and compete for high scores lol.
Recreated this game is .NET MAUI over a weekend using the Microsoft.Maui.Graphics. This is 2D graphics game based on timer. It has few levels and scoring functionality as well.


# Game Story
There is a terrain of building or trees and the helicopter has to move past them without touching any of the buildings. Helicopter by default falls down and the player has to press a button to keep it flying and steer off the obstacles. The Helicopter speed increases as it progresses to next levels and so does the difficulty of game. 

This was a fun project for .NET MAUI and you can learn many concepts. For example,
* How to draw basic graphics?
* Data binding
* Basic 2d game designing
